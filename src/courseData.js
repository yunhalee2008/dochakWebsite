Choices made higher in the hierarchy act as constraints on those made later further down the hierarchy. The calculation of utilities starts at the bottom of the hierarchy. The resulting log sums are passed on to the next level in the hierarchy adding one more choice at each level on the way up the hierarchy. This type of demand modelling is standard practice in the UK and is currently being used by the DfT\'s own National Transport Model with PTV Visum.
